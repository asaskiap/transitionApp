One customer needs reading glasses, for example, while another wants to find out about the advantages and disadvantages of plastic lenses. A third customer needs glasses with a different lens strength than her previous pair. If no examination results from an ophthalmologist are available yet, the need for correction is determined in the optician's store. Upon request, opticians also perform driver's license vision tests.

    'Specialization in beekeeping. A love of animals, an interest in biology and ecology, enjoyment of outdoor activities that involve a lot of movement, a sense of responsibility, the ability to work under pressure, and an independent and committed approach to work are some of the most important prerequisites for being an animal farmer in general. If you are particularly interested in bees, you can specialize in beekeeping. They work, among other things, in apiaries, in queen breeding and pollination operations or are in demand as partners in organic agriculture. The number of beekeepers is about 120,000, with most of the new generation coming from Bavaria. Beekeeping is becoming increasingly popular, especially in cities. Urban beekeeping is therefore often very enthusiastically practiced there, but mostly as a hobby, which is associated with great risks for the sensitive bee colonies due to a lack of expertise. The professionalization of urban beekeeping by specialized animal farmers, who can also be self-employed or work part-time, would therefore be very desirable.',
    'After all, 80% of all cultivated plants must be pollinated by honey bees in order to bear fruit "Beekeepers [thus] make a major ecological contribution to the pollination of flowering plants and at the same time produce a high-quality food. To do this, they feed and care for the bee colonies, maintain the bee shelters, and determine a suitable location for their animals. Once the honeycombs are filled, they remove them and spin them in the extractor room. In the process, they pay attention to hygiene and quality standards."',
    'The dual training program to become an animal farmer usually lasts three years nationwide and can be shortened to two years if the trainee has already completed vocational training or has passed the Abitur (high school diploma). A recognized state training facility in beekeeping is, for example, the Lower Saxony Institute of Apiculture in Celle: ',

    'We had stated in our last newsletter that a trustworthy and competent insurance broker should be of high relevance for dancers and dancers in transition, because they should definitely be well insured due to the very specific dancer profession with diverse risks. Today, as announced, we inform about the very versatile and demanding profession of insurance brokers:',
    'Insurance brokers are NOT insurance agents, because they are merchants. Unlike insurance agents, insurance brokers are not tied to any particular insurance company. "Thus [they are ] an absolutely independent partner. He is therefore also called a "fiduciary trustee" [of] insurance interests." If the broker comes from the artistic branch, perhaps was even a dancer himself, this should be of great advantage, because a lot of important background knowledge about the dance profession itself and the conditions of the dance-artistic professional practice is available, which outsiders can hardly present in this profound way. In addition, dancers in transition already have a very high level of intercultural competence, including multilingualism. This is a great advantage because the profession of insurance broker is becoming increasingly internationalized.',
    'The following tasks belong to the profession: risk analysis/optimization and determination of requirements contract design documentation support and administration (including support in the event of damage)',
    'The profession of insurance broker has been subject to licensing and registration in Germany since 2007 due to the so-called EU Insurance Mediation Directive. In order to be able to work as an insurance broker, you have to meet certain requirements. These include, in any case, a certificate of expertise, which can be acquired, for example, by passing an examination at the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) to become an insurance specialist. This is accompanied by registration with the local Chamber of Industry and Commerce, which is binding for every broker practicing his or her trade and can be checked. Other qualifications are also recognized as proof of expertise, as can be read at the Verband deutscher Versicherungsmakler e.V. (VDVM). (VDVM). ',

    'On the occasion of the foundation of the Circus Academy Berlin (CAB) at the end of 2017, which we reported on above, we would like to draw your attention to the versatile field of activity "circus pedagogy".',
    'The circus disciplines of acrobatics, trapeze, juggling, balance, diabolo, clowning, as de facto forms of play, in combination with music, dance and performance, promote diverse creative body work, better body awareness as well as conceptual thinking. In addition: reflection, self-knowledge and satisfaction through activity and joy in exchange with others. Since circus promotes age-independent cooperation, i.e. community, in a resource- and competence-oriented manner, circus pedagogy also has a very favorable effect on social behavior and thus on diverse group structures. Circus pedagogic offers are generally possible in social work with children, young people, seniors, people with limitations (for example autistic people), for preventive courses in corporate health management (such as for posture problems, stress management strategies), in the rehabilitation of accident victims (balance, strength, responsiveness, etc.) in corporate human resources work (including team building measures, leadership training, conflict resolution, etc.) as well as in the work with traumatized people (e.g. escape, sexual violence, death experience). Circus pedagogy not only enriches dance and theater pedagogical concepts, but can also be combined with other disciplines (e.g. social pedagogy, rehabilitation pedagogy, medicine, curative education, human resources). Therefore, both permanent and freelance employment is conceivable, whereby freelancing probably predominates if the educational background is exclusively circus pedagogy.           ',
    'The CAB offers a full-time continuing education course that lasts nine months, comprises 1,200 hours and, according to the CAB, is currently the only full-time continuing education course in circus pedagogy in Germany with the certificate "Certified Circus Pedagogue". It is by no means only aimed at (former) circus artists and dancers, but also at (dance) teachers, curative education nurses, teachers, educators, social workers and all those seriously interested in the art and performance form of circus/variety. The following knowledge is important for future circus educators and will be taught at CAB: ',
    'Circus pedagogical practice: didactics and methodology in training and lesson structure, games and game forms for circus training / Communication: basics of communication, age-appropriate work, developmental communication / Artistic-aesthetic work processes: History of artistry, working out circus acts with children, presentation of a show, make-up, basic knowledge of light and sound / Self-employed as a circus pedagogue: legal basics of self-employment, self-organization / Training science: training theory, physiology, anatomy, biomechanics.',
