One customer needs reading glasses, for example, while another wants to find out about the advantages and disadvantages of plastic lenses. A third customer needs glasses with a different lens strength than her previous pair. If no examination results from an ophthalmologist are available yet, the need for correction is determined in the optician's store. Upon request, opticians also perform driver's license vision tests.

    "Hearing aid acousticians advise customers on different types of hearing systems and hearing protection. In doing so, they address the individual needs of their customers. This may be due to age-related hearing loss or increased exposure to noise at work. In order to be able to fit a hearing aid optimally, they carry out tests on hearing performance, e.g. they examine how well customers can perceive high and low tones or speech. This requires a general intellectual capacity, mathematical and technical understanding. They also make earmolds for hearing aids or as hearing protection. To do this, they take impressions of the auditory canal, individually fit the earpieces to the customer, install the custom earpieces in the hearing systems and make the fine acoustic adjustments. In other words, it's really a matter of fine motor skills. They also repair and maintain hearing aids and instruct customers on how to use them. They also carry out commercial tasks, such as correspondence. They calculate quotations, prepare statements with health insurance companies or invoices to customers, and keep the customer file.",
